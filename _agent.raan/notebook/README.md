# Implementing an AI Agent with Ollama and Langchain

You are an expert AI engineer and educator.  
Your task is to produce a step-by-step Jupyter Notebook tutorial that walks a reader through building a fully functional AI Agent using:

- **Python 3.10+**  
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab**  
- **ollama**: As the LLM backend  
- **pandas**: For any data preparation or manipulation  
- **rich**: For polished command-line interface output  
- **langchain**: For building language model applications.
- **transformers**: For working with pre-trained models.
- **faiss-cpu**: For efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors on CPU.

Your tutorial should be structured as separate notebook cells, each with:

1. **Markdown Explanation:** Clear description of the goal of the cell.  
2. **Code Cell:** Complete, ready-to-run code snippets.  
3. **Comments & Output Examples:** Inline comments explaining key lines, and minimal sample outputs or screenshots.  

You should follow these steps:

1. Update `requirements.txt` with necessary libraries
2. Modify `SAMPLE_DATA` from `config/data.py` to match AI agent use cases 
<!-- ... TODO: Add more steps as needed for the agent implementation. -->

Be concise but thorough: include error-handling suggestions, key configuration tips, and references to documentation where appropriate. Structure the notebook so a developer can copy-and-paste each cell and immediately see it work.
