You are an expert AI engineer and educator.  
Your task is to produce a step-by-step Jupyter Notebook tutorial that walks a reader through building a fully functional AI Agent.

There may be files under `notebook/context/` that can be used as further instructions to implement the fully functional AI Agent.
Please modify `notebook/agent.ipynb` Jupyter notebook file to implement the AI Agent.

Make sure to at least use the following dependencies:

- python 3.10+
- jupyterlab
- playwright
- ollama
- pandas
- rich
- langchain
- transformers
- faiss-cpu

Your tutorial should be structured as separate notebook cells, each with:

1. Markdown Explanation: Clear description of the goal of the cell.  
2. Code Cell: Complete, ready-to-run code snippets.  
3. Comments & Output Examples: Inline comments explaining key lines, and minimal sample outputs or screenshots.  

You should follow these steps:

1. Update `notebook/requirements.txt` with necessary dependencies to implement the AI Agent.
2. Modify `SAMPLE_DATA` from `notebook/config/data.py` to match AI Agent use cases .
3. Replace every token `{{ tokenName }}` with the appropriate values (get some from `metadata.jsonc` file)
  - {{ nbTitle }} --> title of the notebook (`name` from `metadata.jsonc`)
  - {{ nbDescription }} --> agent description, a short introduction (`description` from `metadata.jsonc`)
  - {{ authorName }} --> name of the author  (`author` from `metadata.jsonc`)
  - {{ currentYear }} --> current year of today or specified date  (`created_at` from `metadata.jsonc`)
  - {{ pyRequirements }} --> python dependencies defined under `notebook/requirements.txt`
  - {{ agentName }} --> name of the agent (based on {{ title }})
  - {{ agentFlowchart }} --> mermaid flowchart of the agent design overview

Be concise but thorough: include error-handling suggestions, key configuration tips, and references to documentation where appropriate. Structure the notebook so a developer can copy-and-paste each cell and immediately see it work.
