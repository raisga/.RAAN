You are an expert AI engineer and educator. Your objective is to produce a comprehensive, step-by-step Jupyter Notebook tutorial demonstrating how to build a fully functional AI Agent.

### Instructions:

* **Base Notebook**: Modify the existing notebook file located at `notebook/agent.ipynb` to implement the AI Agent.

* **Supporting Files**: Check the directory `notebook/context/` for additional instructions or context relevant to the AI Agent's implementation.

### Notebook Structure:

* **ONLY** create or edit files inside `notebook/`*

For **every** instructional step, create two consecutive cells:

1. **Markdown cell**  

   * State the purpose of the step clearly and concisely.  

2. **Code cell**  

   * Provide complete, ready‑to‑run code.  
   * Include inline comments for key lines.  
   * Show minimal example output (print statements or screenshot references).  

*Do **not** append additional sections once the walkthrough ends.*
*The last section should be the interactive AI Agent cell"

### Steps to Follow:

1. **Update Dependencies**:

   * Modify `notebook/requirements.txt` with all necessary dependencies required by the AI Agent.

2. **Configure Sample Data**:

   * Adjust `SYSTEM_PROMPT`, `SAMPLE_DATA` and `MERMAID_DIAGRAM` in `notebook/config.py` to match relevant AI Agent use cases.

3. **Replace Values**:
   Replace all content from the html tags that have `data-tag` attribute, with corresponding values obtained from `metadata.jsonc` or other defined sources:

   * `nbTitle` → Title of the notebook (`name` field in `metadata.jsonc`, create from *context* if empty).
   * `nbDescription` → Description of the agent (`description` field in `metadata.jsonc`, create from *context* if empty).
   * `authorName` → Author’s name (`author` field in `metadata.jsonc`).
   * `currentYear` → Current year based on today's date or a specified date (`created_at` from `metadata.jsonc`).
   * `pyRequirements` → Python dependencies listed in `notebook/requirements.txt`.
   * `agentName` → Name of the agent, derived from `nbTitle`.
   * `agentFlowchart` → Mermaid flowchart representing an overview of the agent's design.

## Quality Expectations  

* **Concise yet thorough** explanations (aim for clarity, avoid fluff).
* Code must run without modification in a clean environment that has the listed dependencies installed.
* Use best practices for readability and maintainability.

### Deliverables  

* Updated **`notebook/agent.ipynb`** following the structure above.
* Updated **`notebook/requirements.txt`** and **`notebook/config.py`**, fully synced with `data-tag` content replacements.
* If needed, create new tools for the agent under **`notebook/tools.py`**.
* If needed, create new helper functions under **`notebook/utils/`**.

*NO other files or sections should be created beyond what this brief specifies.*
