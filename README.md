This repository contains the specifications for the RAAN project, which aims to create a reliable agentic AI notebook system. The specifications outline the architecture of the file extension.

## Usage

To use the RAAN notebook system, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file with the `.raan` extension.
2. Structure the file according to the specifications outlined above.
3. Use a compatible text editor or IDE to edit the file.
4. Save the file to maintain the structure and metadata.

## TODO

- Update `/scripts` to use python scripts instead of bash scripts
- Update `ollama` to `localai` in jupyter notebooks
- Research the best practices for structuring file extensions for AI notebooks.
- Complete the specifications for the file extension, check what is "the  industry standard" when creating a file extension for AI notebooks.
- Add usage instructions on how to use the RAAN notebook.
- Implement a plugin for popular text editors to enhance the editing experience.
